so can you add a remarks input field at the very bottom when i click the tab -> full details.

then there a button apply, if the remarks input field is empty there should be alert or toast that the remarks is required (that's for now dont add such things) 

ok you dont need to rewrite or send the whole code just tell me which file to add, and where do i put the function and such, and remind you, you dont need to overengineered the code
